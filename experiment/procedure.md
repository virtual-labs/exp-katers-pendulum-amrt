## Procedure

### Apparatus

Kater's pendulum, stopwatch, meter scale and knife edges.

### Real Lab Procedure
<ul>
<li>Shift the weight W1 to one end of katers pendulum and fix it. Fix the knife edge K1 just below it.</li>
<li>Keep the knife edge K2 at the other end and fix the wooden weight W2 symmetrical to other end. Keep the small weight 'w' near to centre.</li>
<li>Suspend the pendulum about the knife edge 1 and take the time for about 10 oscillations. Note down the time t1 using a stopwatch and calculate its time period using equation T1=t1/10.</li>
<li>Now suspend about knife edge K2 by inverting the pendulum and note the time t2 for 10 oscillations. Calculate T2 also.</li>
<li>If T2 not equal to T1, adjust the position of knife edge K2 so that T2 approximately equal to T1. </li>
  <li>Balance the pendulum on a sharp wedge and mark the position of its centre of gravity. Measure the distance of the knife-edge K1 as h1 and that of K2 as h2 from the centre of gravity. </li>
</ul>
