## Procedure

### Apparatus

Kater's pendulum, stopwatch, meter scale and knife edges.

### Real Lab Procedure
<ul>
<li>Shift the weight W1 to one end of katers pendulum and fix it. Fix the knife edge K1 just below it.</li>
<li>Keep the knife edge K2 at the other end and fix the wooden weight W2 symmetrical to other end. Keep the small weight 'w' near to centre.</li>
<li>Suspend the pendulum about the knife edge 1 and take the time for about 10 oscillations. Note down the time t1 using a stopwatch and calculate its time period using equation T1=t1/10.</li>
<li>Now suspend about knife edge K2 by inverting the pendulum and note the time t2 for 10 oscillations. Calculate T2 also.</li>
<li>If T2 not equal to T1, adjust the position of knife edge K2 so that T2 approximately equal to T1. </li>
  <li>Balance the pendulum on a sharp wedge and mark the position of its centre of gravity. Measure the distance of the knife-edge K1 as h1 and that of K2 as h2 from the centre of gravity. </li>
</ul>

### Observations and Calculations

To determine T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub>

$$ g=\frac{8\pi^{2}}{\frac{T_{1}^{2}+T_{2}^{2}}{h_{1}+h_{2}}+\frac{T_{1}^{2}-T_{2}^{2}}{h_{1}-h_{2}}} $$

Distance of  K1 from C.G,h1  = ...............m.

Distance of  K2 from C.G,h2 =...............m.

Acceleration due to gravity, g =...............ms<sup>-2</sup>.



### Simulation
<ul>
<li>Choose desired environment from combo box.</li>
<li>Select suitable values for mass of wood cylinder and mass of steel cylinder.</li>
<li>Choose the position of knife edge, steel and wood cylinder by changing the sliders for it.</li>
<li>After choosing values, place the mouse over wood cylinder, drag and make it to oscillate.</li>
<li>Note the time for 10 oscillations, by clicking on the **START** and **STOP** button of the stop watch. </li>
<li>Click on **STOP**  button under variables, for the pendulum to stop oscillating.</li>
<li>Click on the **Invert** button to invert the pendulum.</li>
<li>Again take the time for 10 oscillations.</li>
<li>Click on **Show Measurements** checkbox to get the value of h<sub>1</sub> and h<sub>2</sub>.</li>
<li>Repeat the experiment by changing the values in **variables**. </li>
</ul>
**Note**-When you click on the wood or steel cylinder after selecting all the variables, a box appears if the selected values is not  applicable.

## Result
The acceleration due to gravity at a given place is found to be =...............ms<sup>-2</sup>.
